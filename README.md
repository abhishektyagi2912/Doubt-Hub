Introducing Doubt Hub, it is a Java-based open-source application that allows users to ask questions without hesitation. It provides a platform for both teachers and students with prior experience to answer these questions and engage in discussions. The application also includes a chatbot feature to provide quick responses to user queries. 

With Doubt Hub, students can submit their doubts anonymously, eliminating the fear of judgment or embarrassment. The app ensures complete confidentiality by concealing the identities of both the student asking the doubt and the teachers or special faculty members providing the responses. This anonymity encourages students to freely express their uncertainties, fostering a supportive and inclusive learning environment.
